# SOLID Principles in PHP

Implements **SOLID** principles.

## Single Responsibility Principle
- A class should **only have one responsibility**.

## Open Closed Principale
- Classes should be **open for extension but closed for modification**.

## Liskov Substitution Principle
- If class A is a subtype of class B, we should be able to **replace B with A without disrupting the behavior of our program**.

## Interface Segregation Principale
- Larger interfaces should be **split into smaller ones**.

## Dependency Inversion Principle
- High-level modules should **not depend on low-level modules**. Both should **depend on the abstraction**.
- Abstractions should **not depend on details**. Details should **depend on abstractions**.
